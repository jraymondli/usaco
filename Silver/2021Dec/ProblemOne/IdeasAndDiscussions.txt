Obeservations:
* you can break the number line by other Farmer's cows into segments, and work on each one of them individually first
* farmer John can claim all patches in a segment with two cows, and all patches in the first and last segments with one cow

Idea
1. find the max one cow can claim in each segment
2. sort the numbers from 1
3. look through 2 
4. every time cecking a new number, decide if you want to use two cows based on
   a. there are at least two more cows available from total cows Farmer John has not used in calculation
   b. the total tastiness for the segment is bigger than the max one cow can cliam in this segment, plus max
      one cow can claim in the next segment
